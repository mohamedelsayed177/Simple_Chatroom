## Documentation
### Server
- Uses `net/rpc` to listen for messages.
- Stores all messages in a list and returns chat history after each message.

### Client
- Connects to the server using `rpc.Dial("tcp", "localhost:1234")`.
- Reads full lines using `bufio.NewReader` (handles spaces in messages).
- Sends message objects to the server with client name.
- Displays the returned chat history neatly.
